#### **Conclusion**

We have experimented with using the **boto3 SDK** to create and invoke an agent with **code interpretation** enabled. We also learned how to send files to the agent and receive files returned by the agent in the response stream. We used Markdown rendering to better display the elements that the agent transmits in the response stream, including its rationale, the code it writes to achieve the goal, and the results from code invocation.

#### **Next Steps**

As the next step, you should experiment further with the agent to explore how it can handle more complex requests using code evaluation. In addition to integrating code compilation capabilities, you can explore many other features [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agent-samples/tree/main/examples).
