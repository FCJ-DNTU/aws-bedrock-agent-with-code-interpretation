![architecture](architecture-workshop-04-bedrock-agent.png)

#### **Overview**  

In this workshop, you will learn how to build, deploy, and use **Amazon Bedrock Agent** with **code interpretation and execution capabilities**. You will be guided step-by-step to set up the environment, configure access to Foundation Models, and create sample data for testing.  

Additionally, you will practice **interacting with the Agent**, enabling it to answer mathematical questions, process files, interpret source code, generate visual charts, and automatically create documentation.  

After completing the workshop, you will gain:  
âœ… **In-depth understanding** of Amazon Bedrock and how to build a Bedrock Agent.  
âœ… **Deployment skills** to create an Agent capable of interpreting and executing code.  
âœ… **Integration capabilities** to incorporate Bedrock Agent into real-world applications.  
âœ… **Knowledge of cost optimization** and efficient resource management.  

Letâ€™s dive into exploring **Amazon Bedrock Agent** and its potential! ðŸš€
